Skin Disease Classification with RAG for Chatbot

This project builds an end-to-end AI assistant for dermatology. It uses a ResNet152V2 deep-learning model to classify skin diseases from images (achieving 94% accuracy) and integrates a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbot to provide reliable, reference-based explanations and guidance to users.
